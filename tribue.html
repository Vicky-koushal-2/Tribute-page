<h2>
    Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
</h2>
        <p>
           (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.

            In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.

            Early life and background
        </h2>

        <p>
            
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[6] was born on 2 October 1869[7] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family[8][9] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.[10][11] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.[12]

Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[13] During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, he sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,[13] and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.[14] Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).

        <h2> Father of the Nation</h2>

<p>
   
Indians widely describe Gandhi as the father of the nation.[4][5] Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as "The Father of the Nation".[437] On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as "Father of the Nation".[438][439] He is also conferred the title "Bapu"[440] (Gujarati: endearment for father,[441] papa[441][442]).
